- [ ] Add basic PWA functionality so it can be pinned to the homescreen and used offline
- [ ] Consider adding a way to turn on debug without modifying URL since that won't be possible in PWA
- [ ] Consider refactor into a Preact + Signals app
- [ ] Add a little flash animation when a photo is taken
- [ ] Animate the image from the main camera to the overlay in sequential mode (view transitions?)
